SDK library providing access to make easy and secure transactions with Worken



## Configuration
To ensure flexibility and ease of integration, the Worken SDK allows for configuration through environmental variables. These variables can be set directly in your project's .env file. Below is a list of available configuration variables along with their descriptions:

```WORKEN_POLYGONSCAN_APIKEY:``` This is your API key, which you can generate at: https://polygonscan.com/myapikey. The API key is required for accessing PolygonScan's data programmatically and is essential for querying transaction history, block information data and other blockchain-related information on the Polygon network.
## Usage
#### Install

```
 $ flutter pub add worken-sdk 
```
#### Initialization
```dart
import 'package:worken_sdk/worken_sdk.dart';
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';
import 'package:get_it/get_it.dart';

WorkenSdk.setup(
      provider: Web3Client('https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/', Client()),
      locator: GetIt.instance,
    );
```
| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:------:|:----:|----
| ```provider``` | ```Web3Client``` | if want to use yours client |
| ```lcoator``` | ```GetIt``` | if want to use yours locator |
### Wallet
```dart
WorkenSdk.walletService(); //service to extract functions
```
#### Get wallet balance
```dart
WorkenSdk.walletService().getBalance(address: walletAddress);
```
| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |
------|----|----
| ``address`` | ``String`` | **Required** Your wallet address |

This structure details the balance of a wallet in terms of the WORK token specified in contract, providing the balance in WEI, Ether, and Hexadecimal units.

 - ``WEI (String)``: The balance of the wallet expressed in WEI, which is the smallest denomination of Ether. Given its size, the balance is represented as a string to maintain precision. Example: ``11820000000000000000000``
 - ``Ether (String)``: The balance of the wallet converted into Ether, offering a more readable and commonly used representation of the balance. This conversion is necessary for understanding the balance in terms of Ether, which is more familiar to users. Example: ``11820.000000000000000000``
 - ``Hex (String)``: The balance of the wallet expressed as a hexadecimal value. This format is often used in lower-level blockchain operations and interactions. Example: ``0x0280c373aef4bd300000``
